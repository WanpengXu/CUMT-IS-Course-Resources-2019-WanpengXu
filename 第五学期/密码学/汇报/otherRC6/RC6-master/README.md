In RC6 32/20/128 :                                                                                                                               
  w) 32 it is 4 word with 32 bits                                                                                                              
  r) 20 it is 20 rounds encrypt decrypt                                                                                                          
  b) 128 it is key length in bits                                                                                                              

Options :                                                                                                                             
  Input   : python string with 32 char [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]                                                
  Key     : python string with 32 char [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]                                                            
  Output  : python string with 32 char [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]                                                        

For example!                                                                                                                                       
You make see string = "36C225A911DF0664E9880C2EA9E4DBCC" it could be anything from the parameters                                                  
where in left part hex(3) = int(3) * (int(16) ** 31)                                                                                             
and in right part hec(C) = int(12) * (int(16) ** 0)                                                                                          
it is mean that left part = hight bit and right part = low bit
